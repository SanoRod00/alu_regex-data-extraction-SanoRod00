Dear Team,

Please find the summary of our recent expenditures and contact details for the new vendors.

The last invoice was for $1,250.50, which was paid on 2026-01-15 at 14:30. Another smaller fee of $45.00 is due by tomorrow morning, specifically around 9:15 AM.

We also received a strange message that we should probably ignore:
"Hello! Visit http://malicious-site.com/exploit?id=<script>alert('XSS')</script> for a prize!"
Wait, that looks unsafe. Let's also check this phone number: 123.456.7890.

Vendor 2: Mike (mike.r@dev-hub.org). Phone: 987-654-3210. Website: http://dev-hub.org/portal/index.php?user=123.

Note: Some systems might try to send long strings to crash us, like:
A" * 5000 

Make sure the regex handles these variations!
